# Description:book:

```
"Hi, Blog, I'm Dad" is an app that allows a user to create a new profile, sign-in to their existing profile, view jokes, and save/create their own jokes to their profile.  It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys jumping on the bed!
```

# User Story:feelsgood:

As a person who exists on the planet Earth, I love a good joke. Especially jokes formulated by [New Balance](https://www.newbalance.com/pd/mx608v5/MX608V5-16450.html) wearing, [lawn-mowing](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Green-Machine-62V-Brushless-22-in-Electric-Cordless-Battery-Self-Propelled-Lawn-Mower-with-2-4-0-Ah-Batteries-and-Charger-GMSM6200/315397665?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkOqZBhDNARIsAACsbfIskcNmSVxmeNSw-sKIuRDkchmQVh7_COW8ivjpAy1llbkuu8_YAyMaAuFPEALw_wcB), [Home Depot theme-song-listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-a1-T8VoUA) middle-aged fathers.

[Hi, Blog, I'm Dad](https://hi-blog-im-dad.herokuapp.com/login) offers me the ability to create a new account, view jokes, and post my own jokes on my profile. You don't have to be an owl to see what a 'hoot' it is!

# Future Enhancements:money_with_wings:
Great ideas will go here.  Likely a global launch plan as well as marketing futures to maximaize earning potential.  Eventually, we'll sell out to Meta, and then beyond that, reclaim what is rightfully ours by purchasing and disbanding Meta and renaming it 'Hi, Blog, I'm Dad.'
